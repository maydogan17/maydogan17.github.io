            <br>
            <p class="mb-0">
                The main objective of this project is to create a reliable and thorough 
                livability index for Turkey's provinces. Recognizing that the quality of life in a 
                region isn't determined by a singular facet, a holistic strategy was incorporated. 
                This index is created by compiling and examining data from five crucial areas: culture, 
                education, health care, economy, and risk of natural disasters. The rationale behind such 
                a project is twofold:    
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="mb-0"><b>Informed Decision-Making: </b>Potential residents, companies, or 
                legislators can use this index as a reference to help them make decisions based on 
                measured and objective livability criteria.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="mb-0"><b>Policy Guidance: </b>This project seeks to influence regional policy 
                by highlighting the positive and negative aspects of each province to focus attention
                 and resources where they will have the greatest positive effects on quality of life.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="mb-0">To ensure credibility and relevance, data essential to this project 
                was meticulously sourced from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), İŞKUR, and AFAD.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="display-6 pb-3">How is the Livability Index Calculated?</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="mb-0">Each province's livability index is calculated using a consistent methodology that combines weights, scores, and normalization processes. This guarantees that each factor considered important for determining livability is accurately reflected. An explanation of the process is provided below:
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5 class="display-6 pb-3" style="font-size: 1.75rem;">Category Weighting</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">Distinct domains such as Culture, Education, Healthcare, 
                Economy, and Natural Disaster Risk are attributed weights. These weights highlight
                 the significance that each domain has in deciding overall livability. The distribution 
                 looks like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Culture: 2
                </li>
                <li>Education: 2
                </li>
                <li>Healthcare: 2
                </li>
                <li>Economy: 2
                </li>
                <li>Natural Disaster Risk: 2
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h5 class="display-6 pb-3" style="font-size: 1.75rem;">Metric Scoring</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">Every domain houses specific metrics, each of which is scaled by its performance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Metrics under Culture, Education, and Healthcare are scored from 1 (representing the lowest performance) to 10 (demonstrating outstanding performance).
                </li>
                <li>The Economy domain's Unemployment Rate uses an inverse scoring, where 1 corresponds to the lowest unemployment rate and 10 signifies the highest. This value negatively affects the final score.
                </li>
                <li>Metrics under Natural Disaster Risk, such as Earthquake, Flood, and Landslide/Rock Fall Risks, span between 1 (signifying a minimal risk) and 10 (indicating a high risk). However, these are negatively impacting the final score.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h5 class="display-6 pb-3" style="font-size: 1.75rem;">Aggregation & Normalization</h5>
            <p class="mb-0">
                Within each domain, scores from the respective metrics are aggregated to provide a consolidated
                 view. This aggregate score is then standardized, set within a range of 1 (lowest performance)
                  to 100 (best performance), ensuring consistency and facilitating comparisons.</p>
            <br>
            <h5 class="display-6 pb-3" style="font-size: 1.75rem;">Final Livability Index Calculation
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-0">
                The combined scores from each domain are multiplied by their assigned weights to arrive at 
                the final result. The resulting values are then added together. The value of Natural Disaster 
                Risk is deducted from the final score to account for its negative impact. The result of these
                 processes provides the final livability index, which ranges from 0 (least desirable living 
                 conditions) to 100 (perfect living conditions).

                In the 2021 livability assessment, Marmara emerged preeminent with an index of 
                46.7, predominantly fueled by its economic vitality at 78.88. Trailing closely, 
                Aegean exhibited cultural prowess with a score of 61.66, though its -47.41 in 
                Natural Disasters demands strategic mitigation. Central Anatolia, at 44.27, 
                distinguished itself through an emphasis on Healthcare, notching a score of 
                45.21. The Black Sea region, with an index of 40.15, resonates as an educational 
                hub with the highest average score in the Education metric. However, its economic
                 metric of 51.66 suggests potential growth areas. Meanwhile, the Mediterranean region, 
                 registering 33.28, demonstrated consistent performance but with noticeable natural 
                 disaster risks. Notably, Southeastern Anatolia underscored urgent developmental needs, 
                 languishing with an index of 21.81, particularly concerning the Education sector at 15.27.
